-- Each command may be preceded by line numbers that indicate the lines to operate on
-- There is also the concept of the current line number ("dot")
-- Line_Numbers parses commands to extract line numbers into Start and Stop
--
-- A line number is made up of one or more components, which can be
-- <number>    a non-negative integer representing an absolute line number
-- .           dot, the current line number
-- $           the last line
-- /<pattern>/ forward search: the first line after the current line that contains <pattern>, a regular expression; the search wraps
-- \<pattern>\ backward search: the first line before the current line that contains <pattern>; the search wraps
-- The last pattern specified is remembered and returned by Searching.Current. The shortcuts // and \\ mean to search for the saved
-- pattern
--
-- Nultiple components are separated by the mathematical operators + or -; the line number is the mathematical result of applying
-- these operators to the components
-- .+1         the line after the current line
-- $-10        the 10th line before the last line
--
-- Multiple line numbers are separated by a comma (,) or semicolon (;)
-- A line number followed by a semicolon sets the current line number to the given line number, thus affecting the use of dot in
-- following line numbers;
-- a line number followed by a comma does not affect the current line number
-- /abc/;//;// the 3rd following occurence of "abc"
